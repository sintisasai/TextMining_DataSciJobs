In this project we say that one is looking for a data science job on glassdoor using this link https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-science-jobs-SRCH_KO0,12.htm?jobType=fulltime&fromAge=30. I selected three companies that I would like to try and send an application. The goal of this project is using NLP to analyze job descriptions and reviews of the companies, and this information will be visualized using word clouds. The goal is to gain insights into the sentiments and experiences shared by employees as sourced from the reviews. In specific the goal is to: 

1. Analyze the job descriptions for each company using text mining skills,

2. Analyze the company reviews - if the reviews are too many for any one company I used the first 20 for each company,

3. Pick up the most suitable company as a potential data science job based on the analysis.
