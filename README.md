In this project the aim is to analyze data science job descriptions and company reviews sourced from Kaggle and Indeed. The primary objectives include utilizing Text mining and Natural Language processing techniques to extract key words and identify the most frequently used terms within job descriptions. This information will be visualized through word clouds. I selected three companies, IBM, Ledcor and Amazon that I would like to try and send an application. The goal is to gain insights into the sentiments and experiences shared by employees as sourced from the reviews. In specific the goal is to: 

1. Analyze the job descriptions for each company using text mining skills,

2. Analyze the company reviews - if the reviews are too many for any one company I used the first 20 for each company,

3. Pick up the most suitable company as a potential data science job based on the analysis.
