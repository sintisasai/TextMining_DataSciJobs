In this project we say that one is looking for a data science job on glassdoor using this link https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-science-jobs-SRCH_KO0,12.htm?jobType=fulltime&fromAge=30. I selected three companies that I would like to try and send an application. The goal of this project is to:

1. Analyze the job descriptions for each company using text mining skills,

2. Analyze the company reviews - if the reviews are too many for any one company I used the first 20 for each company,

3. Pick up the most suitable company as a potential data science job based on the analysis.
